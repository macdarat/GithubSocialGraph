## Github Graphs
CS3012 project

Interrogates the Github API to obtain data about the top 50 repositories for 9 languages by number of stars.
C# code and Octokit.net used to search, request and process data from Github. HTML files contain scripts using D3.js to visualise the data as graphs.

### The use of this data

The information gathered is used to try and visualise the difference in the size of the average project in a given language, and the average number of issues that are open at a given point in time for those languages. This information can tell us about the potential results of selecting a certain programming language for a software engineering task. Additionally, the average number of forks is shown. This information can be used to compare which languages generate the most interest from other developers, which could give a rough comparison of the willingness of others to contribute to an opensource project.
